<h3>General info</h3>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eebo-travel/eebo-travel.github.io/master/img/rect2808.png" style="float:right;width:400px;height:500px">
<p class="main">EEBO-Travel is a collection of travel reports from the first phase of <a href="https://textcreationpartnership.org/tcp-texts/eebo-tcp-early-english-books-online/" target="_blank">Early English Books Online</a>, a collection of transliterated English prints available under a CC0 license (i.e., in the public domain). EEBO-Travel is currently work in progress. The version distributed here has been normalized using <a href="http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/vard/about/" target="_blank">VARD2</a> (Rayson & Baron 2008) and tagged using the <a href="https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/" target="_blank">TreeTagger</a> (Schmid 1994), both <span style="color: darkred;">without manual correction</span>. Please keep this in mind when using the corpus. </p>
<p class="main">In the near future, we plan to manually correct the tagging of a small subset of the corpus that is balanced for different time spans and printing locations.</p>

<h3>How to use the corpus</h3>

<p class="main">The corpus files are distributed as VRT files for the <a href="http://cwb.sourceforge.net/">Corpus Workbench</a>. See the CWB website for installation instructions and tutorials. </p>

<p class="main">To encode the VRT files for CWB, you can use the code below. Replace <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">/corpora/data/</span> and <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">/usr/local/share/cwb/registry/</span> by the paths to your data repository and registry, respectively, and replace <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">path/to/vrt</span> by the path to the folder containing the VRT files. Note that you will first have to create an empty folder named "eebotravel" in your data directory.</p>

<div style="background:#ededdd;margin-right:50px;margin-left: 60px">

</div>

<p class="main">To compress the corpus, you can use the following code (again, replace the path if your registry is located in another directory):</p>

<div style="background:#ededdd;margin-right:50px;margin-left: 60px">
<p class="code">cwb-makeall -r /usr/local/share/cwb/registry/ eebotravel</p>

<p class="code">cwb-huffcode -r /usr/local/share/cwb/registry/ eebotravel</p>

<p class="code">cwb-compress-rdx -r /usr/local/share/cwb/registry/ eebotravel</p>
